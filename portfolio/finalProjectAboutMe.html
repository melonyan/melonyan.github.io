      <div class="textBox">
        <h2>Why did I choose to study IT?</h2>
        <p>
          These paragraphs convey a strong personal story and a sense of direction, which is great for a portfolio. However, they can be refined to sound more polished and professional while retaining your unique voice and language style. Here's an improved version:
          
          My journey to deciding what I want to study and who I aspire to become professionally has been anything but linear—it has been colorful and deeply reflective of my evolving interests. 
          <br><br>
          Early on, I dreamed of becoming a prosecutor, then shifted my focus to contemporary dance, followed by design. Eventually, I found my true passion in data science. These varied aspirations represent the core aspects of who I am: someone who values justice, thrives in creativity, and is deeply fascinated by coding, mathematics, and analytics.
          <br><br>
          The decision to pursue a degree in Business Information Technology was a deliberate and strategic choice. This programme blends two essential elements for my career goals: technology and business. I recognized that to become a data scientist, I first needed to build a strong foundation in data analytics. 
          <br><br>
          While bachelor's programmes in data science intrigued me, their entry requirements were beyond my reach at the time. Choosing Business IT allowed me to take a meaningful step toward my ultimate ambition. Through this path, I am honing the skills and qualifications necessary to pursue a master&#39;s degree in data science and to contribute to solving complex challenges in the future.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textBox">
        <h2>Why Data Analysis? Why Data Science?</h2>
        <p>My journey toward discovering a passion for data science began with curiosity. Like many, I initially explored potential career paths by researching industries with strong growth and high earning potential. Among these, data science stood out—not just for its prospects, but for its intriguing combination of mathematics, coding, and analysis, all of which I had a natural affinity for.<br><br>As I delved deeper into the field, I realized it offered much more than financial incentives. It was a space where I could apply my analytical mindset to solve complex problems and uncover meaningful insights from data. This blend of intellectual challenge and practical application resonated deeply with me, sparking a genuine interest and a strong motivation to pursue a career in this dynamic field.<br><br>I&#39;m excited about the opportunities to grow and make meaningful contributions through data science, aligning both my skills and passions with impactful work.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textBox">
        <h2>My Career Goals</h2>
        <p>In the immediate future, I aim to establish myself as a data analyst with a solid foundation in data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. I am committed to developing a deep understanding of tools such as Python, SQL, and Power BI, as well as refining my mathematical abilities to interpret and model data effectively. By mastering these skills, I hope to contribute to data-driven decision-making in a dynamic and collaborative environment.
        <br><br>
        Looking ahead, I plan to pursue a master&#39;s degree in data science to expand my knowledge in areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and big data analytics. This advanced study will allow me to deepen my understanding of data modeling and predictive analysis while positioning myself to tackle more complex challenges in the industry.
        <br><br>
        Ultimately, my goal is to leverage data science to make meaningful contributions, whether that&#39;s optimizing business processes, driving innovation, or addressing real-world issues. I am excited to continuously grow and adapt in this ever-evolving field, combining technical expertise with creative problem-solving to make an impact.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textBox">
        <h2>My Values & Skills</h2>
        <p>My values shape the way I approach both work and learning, driving my growth as a professional and an individual. Curiosity is at the core of who I am—I thrive on exploring new ideas, uncovering patterns, and finding innovative solutions to problems. Integrity is another guiding principle; I believe in being honest and ethical in my work, ensuring that the insights I derive and the decisions I make are fair and reliable. Collaboration is also deeply important to me. I value teamwork and the exchange of ideas, as I believe that working with others fosters creativity and better results.
        <br><br>
        In terms of skills, I bring a strong analytical mindset paired with an enthusiasm for continuous learning. I am proficient in tools such as Excel, SQL, Python, and Tableau, and I enjoy using these to clean, analyze, and visualize data effectively. My mathematical skills allow me to approach challenges with precision and logical reasoning. I also pride myself on being a good communicator, capable of translating complex data into clear, actionable insights.
        <br><br>
        Together, my values and skills equip me to tackle challenges thoughtfully, solve problems effectively, and contribute meaningfully to any project or team I am part of.</p>

        <h2>Personal Interests and Passions</h2>
        <p>This is the real fun part of this About Me, because instead of trying to impress you with all of this technical talk of skills and motivations I get to present myself to you as a complex and perhaps relatable person. Throughout my life I have been very focused on my academic goals, and to be honest I did not get to express myself as much as I probably should have as a child. Now, as an adult, I have a plethora of hobbies. With university, I unfortunately do not have a lot of time to take part in all of these hobbies, but I cherish all of them deeply.<br><br>Here is a nice list of all of my hobbies:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>•	Dancing (hip-hop, contemporary)</li>
          <li>•	Crocheting & amigurumi</li>
          <li>•	Music (singing, playing piano)</li>
          <li>•	Movies & TV Shows (horror, thrillers, historical fiction, 
          fantasy, action, drama)</li>
          <li>•	Fitnerr (pilates, weightlifting, calisthenics)</li>
          <li>•	Art (painting, pastels, digital art)</li>
          <li>•	Fashion (personal style, fashion content)</li>
          <li>•	Gaming (action, simulator, mystery, fantasy, horror)</li>            
        </ul>
        <p>This list of hobbies does quite a good job at illustrating me as an individual. I cherish creativity above all else, but also like more serious things. Sometimes it can get a little overwhelming with what to do next or invest in. I am hoping that once I enter the working life, I will have enough time to take part in my hobbies. I think that achieving this type of balance is very important for humans. </p>
